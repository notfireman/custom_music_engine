# Setup Guide
First and foremost: thank you for using my custom music engine! If you want to support me, please like the original game and if possible, buy the Tip gamepass. It keeps me motivated and allows me to create awesome stuff for the Obby Creator community to enjoy.

With that out of the way... here’s how to set up the Custom Music Engine. 
## Step 1: Prepare the Game
In the top left corner of Studio, click "File", find "Publish to Roblox" and click it.

Give the game a good title like: `SW:R Music Engine`

For the description, you can copy this and fill in the blanks:
```
This is a custom music engine for my project [PROJECT NAME HERE].

Game originally made by ImNotFireMan123:
https://www.roblox.com/games/13940978880/
```
> ⚠️ You are required to have the `Game originally made by ImNotFireMan123: https://www.roblox.com/games/13940978880/` for attribution. If you can't write `Game originally made by ImNotFireMan123`, writing `Game originally made by Fire` is acceptable.

Once you published the game, open https://create.roblox.com/dashboard, and click on the game you just published.

From the Sidebar, find "Access", scroll down until you find "Privacy" and choose Public. Click "Save Changes"

From the Sidebar, find "Places" and click on the place with the same game name. It should say "Start Place" below it. 

Continuing from that, find "Access" from the Sidebar, find "Maximum Vistor Count" and change it to a number between 1 to 8. Click "Save Changes".
